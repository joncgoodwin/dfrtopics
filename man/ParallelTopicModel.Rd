\title{Access MALLET's model object}
\usage{
ParallelTopicModel(m)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{a \code{mallet_model} object}
}
\value{
a reference to the ParallelTopicModel object
}
\description{
This function returns a reference to the main Java object representing an LDA
model in MALLET.
}
\details{
For its R interface, MALLET uses a class RTopicModel, but most of the
modeling functionality is carried out by a ParallelTopicModel instance. This
object is reachable from R. Once you have the reference to it here, you can
use rJava to access all its public methods and members.

Java's strict typing means you'll have some funtimes with
\code{\link[rJava]{.jcall}}. To index into array-like objects from Java,
apply \code{\link[base]{as.integer}} to parameters.
